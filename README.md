Simply download the file you want to run.
For example, suppose you download 'hello-0.c' file in the 'Downloads' folder of your computer.
To run this file, open the 'Downloads' folder in the terminal, and run

cc hello-0.c

or

gcc hello-0.c

You will see a file such as 'a.exe' in the 'Downloads' folder.
Then execute,

./a.exe

You should see the output in the terminal.

The sequence is as follows:

0-hello-0.c

1-hello-1.c

2-farenheit-celsius-0.c

3-farenheit-celsius-1.c

4-farenheit-celsius-2.c

5-farenheit-celsius-3.c

6-farenheit-celsius-4.c

7-file-copying-0.c

8-file-copying-1.c

9-character-counting-0.c

10-character-counting-1.c

11-line-counting.c

12-space-counting.c

13-file-copying-2.c

14-file-copying-3.c

15-word-counting.c

16-one-word-one-line.c

I will keep updating the sequence as I upload more files.
