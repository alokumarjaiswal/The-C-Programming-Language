Simply download the file you want to run.
For example, suppose you download 'hello-0.c'  file in the 'Downloads' folder of your computer.
To run this file, open the 'Downloads' folder in the terminal, and run
cc hello-0.c
or
gcc hello-0.c
You will see a file such as 'a.exe' in the 'Downloads' folder.
Then execute,
./a.exe
You should see the output in the terminal.

The sequence is as follows:
hello-0.c
hello-1.c
farenheit-celsius-0.c
farenheit-celsius-1.c
farenheit-celsius-2.c

I will keep updating the sequence as I upload more files.
