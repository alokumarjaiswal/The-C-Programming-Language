Simply download the file you want to run.
For example, suppose you download '0-hello-0.c' file in the 'Downloads' folder of your computer.
To run this file, open the 'Downloads' folder in the terminal, and run

cc 0-hello-0.c

or

gcc 0-hello-0.c

You will see a file such as 'a.exe' or 'a.out' in the 'Downloads' folder.
Then execute,

./a.exe

or

./a.out

You should see the output in the terminal.

The sequence is as follows:

0-hello-0.c

1-hello-1.c

2-farenheit-celsius-0.c

3-farenheit-celsius-1.c

4-farenheit-celsius-2.c

5-farenheit-celsius-3.c

6-farenheit-celsius-4.c

7-file-copying-0.c

8-file-copying-1.c

9-character-counting-0.c

10-character-counting-1.c

11-line-counting.c

12-space-counting.c

13-file-copying-2.c

14-file-copying-3.c

15-word-counting.c

16-one-word-one-line.c

17-arrays.c

18-horizontal-histogram-lw.c

19-vertical-histogram-lw.c

20-histogram-fc.c

21-functions.c

22-functions-farenheit-celsius.c

I will keep updating the sequence as I upload more files.
