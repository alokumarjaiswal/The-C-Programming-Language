#include <stdio.h>

/* '#incude <stdio.h>' incudes the standard I/O library header file.
    .h represents a header file.
    This file contains the definition of 'printf' function.
    The 'printf' function stands for print formatted,
    and is not part of the C language.
    There is no input or output defined in C itself.
    'printf' is just a useful function from the standard library of
    functions that are normally accessible to C.
    The 'printf' function can accept format string and variables as arguments.
    The 'main' function is special.
    Generally, we are at the liberty of naming our function.
    But every program must have a 'main' function somewhere,
    as the execution of any program starts froms the 'main' function.
